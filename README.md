# Discussion :

VGG gives more accuracy than Resnet but it requires more training time than Resnet. It is costly in terms of parameters so it provides that much high accuracy easily.
Resnet requires less training time than VGG but due to less parameters it is not able to provide that high accuracy in comparison to vgg. But setting optimal parameters like learning rate we can tune this to work better.
